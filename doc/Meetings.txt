Log of our Meetings

Hours.txt outlines our hours worked each day individually and as a group.  For meetings, we met before or after Fundcomp to check in most Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. We agreed on which tasks we would need to complete to have a fully functioning browser, and decided to take on each of these tasks one at a time to try to knock them out. Since this project had many modular components and functionality, we did not need to have a very linear workflow, and were able to use a waterfall-like method of development. This allowed to create a pool of tasks and complete them without worrying about the order in which they were completed. We were able to use this development method in part because of the Qt framework that we were using, which allowed us to add objects and methods onto our top-level mainwindow object at our own discretion.

Our only true meeting that took place out of class was on 4/24 at 7:30 pm. Both Rob and Ben showed up to this meeting. We met in LaFun to discuss the final stage of the project and how to get tabs and tab history to work (which was proving to be a very elusive problem for us at the time). We figured it out together and decided on more things that we wanted to add before the deadline (Ben chose bookmarks and Rob chose the autocomplete feature).
