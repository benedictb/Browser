Fundamentals of Computing project in C++

    Additional Ideas: 
        making a text editor or browser, I think having a tool in either of these where you can quickly search things on stack overflow. Qt has this functionalilty for google, but I think it may be possible to do with stack overflow or cplusplus, etc. I think this would be especially cool in a text editor. Or being able to view code examples quickly from cplusplus.
