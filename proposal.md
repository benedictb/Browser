FTP Gui written in C++
======================

- ability to connect to a computer and transfer files visually

- two windows, one for destination, one for source

- a couple of switches and buttons e.g. copy or move...delete..

- beautiful GUI

- maybe other features? 

OOP: Each button will be an object, the windows will be objects....each file will be an instance of an object.

- File object will be the parent object of files, directories and binaries.

You'll have the option of viewing the text of text files...

#Other ideas



Peer to peer file transfer utility
==================================

- can quickly send files to another person, takes out the middle man for github & other sharing

- a useful resource for when you have to share code quick

- can easily see if someone else is on, specifically target someone or several persons to send the thing to

- perhaps sync the files? rsync


Web browser
===========

- QT has a library that gets the basics done for you

- Needs to save bookmarks, write scripts, etc

- Would have to think about more ideas / but a cool way to use unix networking commands
